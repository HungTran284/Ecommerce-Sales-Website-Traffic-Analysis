### Company’s Sales performance
- 10.4B VND in gross revenue generated with over 30K customers and 37.8K unique orders.
- Average Order Value (AOV) approx. 275K VND, equivalent to 1.24 orders per customer.
- Order completion rate was 80%, cancellations accounted for 20% of total orders.
- Only 8.3B VND came from completed orders, while 2.1B VND were cancelled.

- Most data points fall below the trend line, showing many customers are willing to pay higher prices without heavy promotions.

## 2. Website traffic analysis
This Traffic Dashboard provides an overview of Seller A’s website performance, visualizing key metrics such as traffic sources, engagement, and conversion to identify opportunities for improving efficiency and driving growth.

### Company’s Traffic performance
- Revenue & Users: In July, revenue reached 10B with over 10,000 transactions. Out of 657K users, 529K (80.6%) were new, showing strong customer acquisition.
- Website Performance: Bounce Rate was 68.1%, indicating many visitors left immediately. Users viewed 2.85 pages per session on average, spending 141 seconds, showing moderate engagement with room to guide them further.
- Purchasing Performance: Revenue per session was ~8,000, but Conversion Rate was only 0.45%, highlighting high traffic but low conversion and need to optimize the shopping experience.
**Insight:** Although traffic volume is high, the Conversion Rate remains relatively low, emphasizing that company need to optimize the shopping experience and customer journey to increase revenue.

### Medium performance & Revenue
- All other medium account for only a very small proportion, about 3–4% of revenue.
- Cost Per Click (CPC) brings in the most revenue, over 6.6 billion (66%).
- Social makes 13%, Direct 10%, and Referral 7%.
**Insight:** Revenue is concentrated in just a few sources so company should consider diversifying its medium to reduce risk.

### Conversion and Efficiency
- Email has the highest conversion rate at over 2.5%, showing it is highly effective in driving purchases.
- Zalo, Direct, Organic, and Referral follow with around 1% conversion, showing potential for optimization.
- CPC, Display, and Social have much lower conversion rates, highlighting their limitations in turning traffic into revenue.
**Insight:** Although Email doesn’t generate the most revenue, it attracts customers who are more likely to buy. Can make it into a focused and efficient medium.

### Engagement Impact on Conversion
- Most high revenue sources are concentrated around 4–5 pages per session and 200–400 seconds of average session duration.
- Some sources attract visitors who spend a long time on the website and view many pages but have not yet converted.
**Insight:** Customers interact deeply before purchasing, indicating high-quality traffic. This suggests there is potential to increase revenue by improving user experience.

### Value per Visit
- Email has high RPS and low Bounce Rate, showing that traffic from this medium is high-quality and users engage deeply.
- Direct and CPC also show fairly good RPS and Bounce Rate.
- In contrast, Social has a high Bounce Rate and low RPS, indicating that users from this medium leave quickly and contribute little value.
**Insight:**  This suggests the company should focus on mediums like Email, Direct, and CPC for quality traffic, while finding ways to improve engagement from Social.

## 3. Recommendation for August
### With Sales performance
- Cancellation & Repeat order: The overall cancellation rate was high at 20%, and second-purchase cancellations reached 39%, indicating issues in customer experience, promotions, or delivery.
**Recommendation:** Review fulfillment process to reduce cancellations and introduce loyalty programs, special offers for boosting repeat purchases. Increasing discount without improving after-sales services could backfire.
- Low AOV Orders & Discounts: High-value orders received bigger discounts and had higher completion rates, while low-value orders or heavily discounted orders faced more cancellations.
**Recommendation:** Encourage higher order value through upselling, bundle offers, or spending-based rewards. Focus marketing resources on high spending customers.
- Promotion campaign: only effective during 1 - 2 days, after which its impact quickly diminished.
**Recommendation:** Run smaller promotions more often and give customers simple rewards to keep sales steady.

### With Traffic performance
- Poor Traffic Quality: Most users were new, but Bounce Rate was 68% and Conversion Rate only 0.45%, additionally traffic volume was high but conversion efficiency remained low indicating their potential is being wasted.
**Recommendation:** Improve landing page experience, optimize page loading speed, and add clear CTAs to reduce bounce and increase conversions. Focus budget on high-performing content.
-- Potential Customer: Users spending 200-400 seconds and viewing 4-5 pages are more likely to purchase, but some highly active visitors still do not convert.
**Recommendation:** Optimize the conversion process by simplifying key actions and offer incentives.
-- Email Performance: Email generated less revenue but had the highest conversion rate (>2.5%), indicating high-quality traffic with strong purchase intent.
**Recommendation:** Expand the mailing list, run automated campaigns such as cart abandonment reminders or cross-sell suggestions.
